Sure! Let’s summarize what exactly happened, why the issue appeared, and how we resolved it step by step.

🟦 The Issue

You were on dev branch and made changes, including a Word file:

origin_branching_and_how_it_works.docx


You pushed dev to GitHub — everything fine on dev.

Then you switched to main and tried to merge dev → main:

git checkout main
git merge dev


Git gave this message:

warning: Cannot merge binary files: origin_branching_and_how_it_works.docx (HEAD vs. dev)
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in origin_branching_and_how_it_works.docx
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

🟩 Why This Happened

Git tried to merge dev into main automatically.

The file origin_branching_and_how_it_works.docx is a binary file (Word document).

Git cannot automatically merge binary files, unlike text files.

Git reported a merge conflict because:

Both branches (main and dev) have different versions of the same file

Git doesn’t know which version to keep

🟧 What We Did to Fix It

Since you wanted to keep the dev version:

Checked out the dev version of the file:

git checkout --theirs origin_branching_and_how_it_works.docx


Marked the conflict as resolved:

git add origin_branching_and_how_it_works.docx


Committed the merge:

git commit -m "Merge dev into main, keep dev version of binary file"


Pushed main to GitHub:

git push origin main

🟢 What This Achieved

The main branch now contains all updates from dev.

The Word file origin_branching_and_how_it_works.docx is exactly the version from dev.

The conflict is resolved and the merge is complete.

GitHub main branch is now in sync with dev.

🔑 Key Takeaways

Binary files can’t be auto-merged — always resolve manually.

--theirs = keep the incoming branch (dev) version

--ours = keep the current branch (main) version

Always git add after resolving conflicts and then git commit.

After merging, push to update the remote repo.
